"**Disclaimer** this tool needs a [peptide database](https://csbiology.github.io/ProteomIQon/tools/peptideDb.html) and [peptide spectrum matches](https://csbiology.github.io/ProteomIQon/tools/PeptideSpectrumMatching.html)\n",

"\n",
"MS-based shotgun proteomics estimates protein abundances using a proxy: peptides. The process of \u0027Protein Inference\u0027 is concerned with the mapping of identified peptides\n",
"to the proteins they putatively originated from. This process is not as straightforward as one might think at a first glance on the subject, since the peptide-to-protein mapping\n",
"is not necessarily a one-to-one relationship but in many cases a one-to-many relationship. This is due to the fact that many proteins share peptides with an identical sequence, e.g.\n",
"two proteins originating from two different splice variants of the same gene.\n",
"\n",
"One way to cope with this problem is to introduce the concept of protein groups, which allow us to report the aggregation of all peptides which map to all isoforms of a gene\n",
"independently from the peptides mapping uniquely to a single isoform. While this approach has its merits it leaves room for fine tuning when implemented. Lets say we have two proteins pA and pB which were both\n",
"discovered by one peptide uniquely mapping to each of them and additionally by a third peptide, which maps to both of them: How do we report our findings?\n",
"We could report both proteins seperately and as a protein group, we could only report the protein group, or we could report both proteins but not the protein group. A problem of comparable complexity occurs when\n",
"we think about peptides when calculating the abundances for the proteingroup pA;pB. Do we use the peptides only once, or do we also use the peptides mapping uniquely to protein pA and pB? \n",
"Fortunately, the tool ProteinInference gives you the possibility to choose any of the described scenarios by tuning the parameters described below. \n",
"The following scheme gives an overview how parameter settings influence inferred protein groups:\n",

"\u003cimg src=\"https://csbiology.github.io/ProteomIQon/img/ProteinInference.png\" width=\"1200\" height=\"1000\" /\u003e\n",
"\n",
"Moreover, we report each protein group with a so called \u0027Peptide evidence class\u0027. This metric gives an indication how pure the peptide composition of a protein group is and\n",
"lets us differentiate between protein groups that consist of isoforms of a splice variant or contain a rather arbitrary mix of proteins. In order to determine these inter-protein relationships the\n",
