"# How to create a tool\n",
"\n",
"If you want to extend the functionality of the ProteomIQon you can either submit a pull request to update\n",
"an existing tool or - if the functionality is better encapsulated as a stand alone application - create a new tool.\n",
"To make this as as easy as possible we created a tool template which sets up a basic scaffold for your new tool!\n",
"\n",
"## Installing the template:\n",
"Assuming that you have cloned the ProteomIQon repository you can install the tool by navigating to the project root and calling: \n",
"\n",
"\tdotnet new --install ./ConsoleTemplate/template\n",
"\n",
"The installation can then be verified by executing the following snippet:\n",
"\n",
"\tdotnet new --list \n",
"\n",
"This should print a list of installed templates. If everything was successful you will find the line among the installed tools: \n",
"\n",
"\tTemplates                           Short Name               Language          Tags\n",
"\t------------------------------      -------------------      ------------      ----------------------------------------\n",

"\tprototypical proteomiqon co...      pct                      F#                proteomiqon console/proteomiqon/template\n",
"\t...\n",
"\n",
"## Adding a new tool to the project:\n",
"To initialize a new tool using the template, navigate into the \u0027src\u0027 folder, replace \u0027projectName\u0027 with your choice for a tool name and call:\n",
"\n",
"\tdotnet new pct -n \"projectName\" --force\n",
"\n",
"Afterwards navigate back to the project root and execute the following line to add your tool to the ProteomIQon solution:\n",
"\n",
"\tdotnet sln ProteomIQon.sln add \"./src/projectName/projectName.fsproj\"\n",
"\n",
"Afterwards you should be good to go! Have fun extending the ProteomIQon, we look forward to your contribution!\n",
